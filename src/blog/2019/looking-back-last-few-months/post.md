This is a quick post just to say I'm still alive.

It's been a few months since I wrote anything for my personal site but I'm hoping to pick up with regular posts again soon. It's been a busy year for me - turns out that even planning a modestly small wedding takes a fair amount of time and energy!

I've also been busy teaching and working, travelling to a few conferences, running events and dabbling in various hobbies.

I've also started tending to an allotment and trying to spend more time outdoors, which has kept me away from a computer screen at weekends. And I've been reading a lot - I might make the big ðŸ’¯ books this year, at this rate!

Did I mention I passed my **AWS Associate Developer** exam earlier this year? I can't remember. But I did.

Unfortunately <a href="https://conju-gator.com/" target="_blank">conju-gator.com</a> has been a little neglected over the last few months but I made my first commit in over a hundred days last weekend, so things are afoot again.

Hopefully I'll be able to post a little more regularly from now on.
