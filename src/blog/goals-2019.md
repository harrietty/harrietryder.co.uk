Here are a few things, in no particular order, that I want to achieve next year.

I'll revisit them every quarter to see how I'm doing.

1. üíª **Become a Certified AWS Developer/Architect** I want to take these 2 exams, which I've been studying for recently.

Metric: Pass the exam, gain the certificate etc.

2. üë©‚Äçüè´ **Run another CodeFirst:Girls course** I've already agreed to this, so it's just a case of actually doing it...

Metric: Do it.

3. üèÉ‚Äç **Run another 2 marathons** I've totally got this! I've got one booked in April, and I'd like to do another one at the end of the summer somewhere exciting.

Metric: Complete the marathons

4. üíç **Get married** Mauro and I got engaged, so the next logical step is marriage.

Metric: Be married

5. üêæ **Walk another section of the Camino de Santiago**

Metric: Do it

6. ‚úçÔ∏è **Publish a blog post, video or piece of content every week** This is a real stretch goal, because producing blog posts at the moment takes me a long time, but I want to find a format that allows me to produce things more quickly, in smaller chunks, so I don't keep ending up with mammoth posts that take me aeons to polish and publish. Also, I'd like to get back into making programming videos, I just haven't settled on what exactly I'd like to produce...

Metric: 52 "pieces of content" by the end of the year

7. üìö **Keep reading regularly in Spanish**

Metric: 12 books read by the end of the year

8. üí∞ **Generate a side income** I want to develop a side project that delivers an income. No matter how small, I want to land on something that I can continue to work at in the future, something I that gives a bit of meaning/legitimacy to the work I do outside of work and excites me. This might be freelance stuff, or building an App with the intention of getting it in an app store.

Metric: Make >¬£1 profit doing something outside of work

9. ü§∏‚Äç **Take my yoga to the next level** Wow I don't like the sound of how I've phrased that one, but you know what I mean. I want to either go to a course, take a training course, or maybe to on a retreat (perhaps in an Ashram?!?). I need to see how things pan out with holidays, getting married, etc. but I'd really like to take the opportunity, if I can, to take my yoga practice further.

Metric: Be able to (if called upon) teach yoga to a small group of people

10. üßò **Take meditation more seriously again** Earlier this year I was doing a lot of meditation, but I don't think I kept it up long enough to really see the benefits. I'd like to go to some classes this year to really learn how I can get the most out of it. There are several centres near where I live, so I have some good options.

Metric: Feel like practicing meditation brings a benefit

11. üê¶ **Promote myself better** I feel like I publish quite a lot on the web but I'm pretty rubbish at self promotion, so that's something I'd like to improve. Increasing followers seems like an easy metric to track.

Metric: 1000 Twitter followers in total by the end of the year

And.... finally... the big one:

üç∫ **Give up alcohol**

This is something I've wanted to do, and have done on and off, for a long time. I think it's finally time. About 8 months ago I gave up coffee which I always thought would be harder than booze since I'm sure I genuinely was addicted to it, so if I can do that then I'm sure I can do this.

My main strategy for the beginning is to avoid situations where I know I'll be tempted/pressured to drink.

After that I'll figure out better strategies for socialising in places and at events where drinking alcohol is encouraged.

Wish me luck!
