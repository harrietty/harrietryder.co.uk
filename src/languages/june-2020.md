## Arabic

This month I Focussed fully on learning to read the Arabic script.

I followed this free <a href="http://arabicreadingcourse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arabic Reading Course</a>, making <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anki</a> flashcards for all the words introduced throughout the course.

I haven't yet written a single word of Arabic, which is fine. I'm more concerned about being able to improve my reading speed and recognise some common words.

## Español

- ITalki classes
