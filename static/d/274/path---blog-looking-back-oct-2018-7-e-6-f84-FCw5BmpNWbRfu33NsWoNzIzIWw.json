{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>October seems to have absolutely flown by, and it's been one of those months where I feel like achieved a lot and made the most of all 31 days, but without feeling exhausted at the end of it all. There have been days I've wished there were a couple more hours in the day to unwind and read a book or relax, but overall I've prioritised the things that at the time have been most important.</p>\n<h5>Running</h5>\n<p>At the beginning of the month, Mauro and I spent the weekend with my Mum in the Dales and I began running long distances again after being injured and on holiday during September. And last weekend, I ran my longest run <em>ever</em> of 20 miles. It was supposed to be a race in Leeds but there was a train strike (do trains ever actually run between Leeds and Manchester?) so I had to relocate and do it on my own in Manchester instead. 20 miles is probably the longest I will run before my marathon in December. I was a bit miffed because my Garmin didn't tell me that it was my longest run, but I'm absolutely positive I've never run that far before. I think I would have remembered.</p>\n<p>It wasn't nearly as bad as I was anticipating. It was a cold day which helped, since I didn't sweat too much and get dehydrated, and surprisingly my legs were absolutely fine the next day. I really hope I have another 6 miles in me to get me to the finish line of the marathon... everyone's got another 6 miles in them though, right?</p>\n<h5></h5>","frontmatter":{"title":"Looking back at October","date":"1st Nov, 2018","tags":["review","personal","life"],"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/looking-back-oct-2018/"}}
