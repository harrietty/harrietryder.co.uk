{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>October seems to have absolutely flown by, and it's been one of those months where I feel like achieved a lot and made the most of all 31 days, but without feeling exhausted at the end of it all. There have been evenings I've wished there were a couple more hours in the day to unwind and read a book or relax, but overall I've prioritised the things that at the time have been most important.</p>\n<p>Things like making cakes...</p>\n<p>And running on lovely chilly mornings...</p>\n<p>Mentoring at <a href=\"\">Codebar</a> and <a href=\"\">CodeFirst:Girls</a></p>\n<p>... and continually learning</p>\n<h5>Running</h5>\n<p>At the beginning of the month, Mauro and I spent the weekend with my Mum in the Dales and I began running long distances again after being injured and on holiday during September. And last weekend, I ran my longest run <em>ever</em> of 20 miles. It was supposed to be a race in Leeds but there was a train strike (do trains ever actually run between Leeds and Manchester?) so I had to relocate and do it on my own in Manchester instead. 20 miles is probably the longest I will run before my marathon in December. I was a bit miffed because my Garmin didn't tell me that it was my longest run, but I'm absolutely positive I've never run that far before. I think I would have remembered.</p>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.44649933949802%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Long run\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/run-2165d0613ed7fbc26c373d50c00b601d-0996b.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/run-2165d0613ed7fbc26c373d50c00b601d-fa718.png 163w,\n/static/run-2165d0613ed7fbc26c373d50c00b601d-1ce8d.png 325w,\n/static/run-2165d0613ed7fbc26c373d50c00b601d-0996b.png 650w,\n/static/run-2165d0613ed7fbc26c373d50c00b601d-bf376.png 975w,\n/static/run-2165d0613ed7fbc26c373d50c00b601d-021cf.png 1300w,\n/static/run-2165d0613ed7fbc26c373d50c00b601d-49a6a.png 1514w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<p>It wasn't nearly as bad as I was anticipating. It was a cold day which helped, since I didn't sweat too much and get dehydrated, and surprisingly my legs were absolutely fine the next day. I really hope I have another 6 miles in me to get me to the finish line of the marathon... everyone's got another 6 miles in them though, right?</p>\n<h5>Reading</h5>","frontmatter":{"title":"Looking back at October","date":"1st Nov, 2018","tags":["review","personal","life"],"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/looking-back-oct-2018/"}}
