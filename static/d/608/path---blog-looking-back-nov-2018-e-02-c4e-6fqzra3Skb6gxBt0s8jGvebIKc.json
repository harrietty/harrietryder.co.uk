{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Wooo, it's the 1st December! This is super exciting because <a href=\"https://adventofcode.com/\">Advent of Code</a> for 2018 has just gone live, and this means 25 days of coding challenges to complete in the run-up to Christmas. I'm not joking, AoC really is a December highlight for me. I love how tough the problems get, and the limited timeframe for the advent calendar. It's easy to commit to because it's only 25 days (and I know I'm not gonna make it all the way anyway) and it's a great chance to practice raw problem solving skills. </p>\n<p>In other years, I've competed as part of a Northcoders team where we gave prizes for first, second and third place but this year I guess I'll just be competing against the global leaderboard (and Mauro), which means no prizes haha and not even any recognition because everyone else is really good. Some people literally complete the challenges before I've even had time to read them ðŸ¤·</p>\n<p>I am also looking forward to this month because</p>\n<p>ðŸ”¶ Mauro's Mum is coming to stay with us after Christmas\nðŸ”¶ Christmas!\nðŸ”¶ Engagement party (Me and Mauro got engaged!)\nðŸ”¶ Running a marathon (not sure if I'm actually looking forward to this)\nðŸ”¶ Having more free time once I stop having to train for the marathon\nðŸ”¶ Final CodeFirst:Girls session\nðŸ”¶ Cooking lots of yummy food\nðŸ”¶ Work Christmas do, which is going to be a walk and pub lunch</p>\n<p>Anyway, enough about next month. What's been going on in November?</p>\n<p>Well, firstly and most importantly me and Mauro got engaged! He asked me a couple of weeks ago and of course I said yes. We went to see Swan Lake the next day, which was not intended as a celebration but turned out to be. At the weekend we went to town and bought a ring, and began to think about what we wanted to do for a wedding. At the moment we haven't made any firm plans but it will be next year some time. We will probably go for something small and local, and will maybe have 2 celebrations - one here in Manchester and another in Valencia. I'm super excited, and I can't wait to have all our friends round to celebrate at our engagement party in December.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"md-figure\">\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"swanlake\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/swanlake-1bb1e0b8cb75dd27103300ed334e1bd5-0996b.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/swanlake-1bb1e0b8cb75dd27103300ed334e1bd5-fa718.png 163w,\n/static/swanlake-1bb1e0b8cb75dd27103300ed334e1bd5-1ce8d.png 325w,\n/static/swanlake-1bb1e0b8cb75dd27103300ed334e1bd5-0996b.png 650w,\n/static/swanlake-1bb1e0b8cb75dd27103300ed334e1bd5-bdd4c.png 900w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  <figcaption>At Swan Lake</figcaption></figure></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Looking back at October","date":"1st Dec, 2018","tags":["review","personal","life"],"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/looking-back-nov-2018/"}}
